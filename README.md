## Hi there 👋

**RobKittenz/RobKittenz** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I am currently going through the BIA bootcamp with TripleTen, previously I have been in banking and management for 15 years, and am looking to use my expertise and what I have learned through my life to help make this transition easy. I am excited to get this new chapter in my life started and see where it leads. In my free time I enjoy any kind of tabletop gaming, golf, or just relaxing and conversating with interesting people. I am currently working on learning this new skill and excited to do whatever I can to become an expert.
